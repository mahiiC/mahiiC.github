excerpt: 'Microfibers have adverse effects on the environment and have a widespread distribution all over the ecosystem due to the extensive production and usage of plastic products. Microfibers include tiny plastic particles, polyester, and nylon released from various sources like textile wastes, industrial effluents, E-waste, and hospital wastes. These tiny fibers can easily get incorporated into the food chain and propagate in human systems causing long-term health defects. This chapter includes different impacts of microfiber pollution. About 40% of microfiber pollutants are eventually ending up in the water bodies. They affect the nutrient balance and BOD levels of aquatic life forms causing genetic dysfunction. The large accumulation of microplastics can affect soil quality and nutrient cycling, affecting the soil microflora. Being light-weight and minute, they can easily enter the human respiratory system through the air. As a result of the 2019 pandemic, a large deposition of single-use masks has contributed immensely towards the polypropylene accumulation. These masks release large amounts of microfibers which destructs the soil ecosystem and hinder the development of flora and fauna. This chapter also discusses various bioremediation methods to regulate the negative impacts of microfibers on the environment.'

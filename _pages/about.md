Iâ€™m an aspiring Bioinformatician & Data Scientist, currently pursuing my **MS by Research in Bioinformatics** at **IIIT Hyderabad**. Iâ€™m particularly interested in **Omics data analysis** and in exploring how **Machine Learning** can be applied to uncover patterns in large and complex biological datasets that go undetected by the human brain.  


ðŸ’¡ **Fun fact:** I donâ€™t just stare at the computer all the time. Iâ€™ve also spent a fair bit of time in the lab growing bacteria, extracting proteins, running gels, and doing all the wet lab things that most bioinformaticians politely avoid. ðŸ˜„ So if you're looking for someone who speaks both pipettes and Pythonâ€”you know who to call!  


Beyond academia, I like to immerse myself in mystery thriller movies and fiction novels. I also love learning new languages (currently learning Japanese!) and doodling. I'm also a trained artist and self-taught vocalist.
